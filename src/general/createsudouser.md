## Creating a Sudo User on Ubuntu 16.04

The  `sudo`  command provides a mechanism for granting administrator privileges, ordinarily only available to the root user, to normal users. This guide will show you the easiest way to create a new user with sudo access on Ubuntu, without having to modify your server's  `sudoers`  file. If you want to configure sudo for an existing user, simply skip to step 3.

### Steps

 1. Log in to your server as the  `root`  user.
 
```bash
local$ ssh root@server_ip
```

 2. Create a new user account using the  `adduser`  command. Donâ€™t forget to replace  `username`  with the user name that you want to create.

```bash
server$ adduser username
```

 - You will be prompted to set and confirm the new user password. Make sure that the password for the new account is as strong as possible.

    ```output
    Set password prompts:
    Enter new UNIX password:
    Retype new UNIX password:
    passwd: password updated successfully
    ```
    
 - Follow the prompts to set the new user's information. It is fine to accept the defaults to leave all of this information blank.
    
    ```output
    User information prompts:
    Changing the user information for username
    Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
        Full Name []:
        Room Number []:
        Work Phone []:
        Home Phone []:
        Other []:
    Is the information correct? [Y/n]
    ```

3. Use the usermod command to add the user to the sudo group.

```bash
  server$ usermod -aG sudo username
```
